				<p><strong>UiS Drillbotics</strong> This was the project that sparked my love for electronics,
					programming, and robotics. In my last semester of my masters degree in Petroleum Engineering, I
					blindly signed up to be the last member of my universities Drillbotics team and was handed the role
					of software/hardware programmer which to my surprise, no one else wanted. What followed was a
					semester full of all-nighters, hair pulling, and constant confusion but I loved every second. In the
					end, an unfortunate last minute switch to a different stabilizer resulted in failed pipe fittings
					and we finished tied for 3rd.</p>

								This was the initial concept and design by our chief scientist Eric Cayeux. The main
								idea is to spin a measuring wheel that has 4 "vanes" supporting them at a constant RPM
								and have a fluid enter in between those discs. These spinning vanes will expel the
								incoming fluid, applying a force on the vanes due to the coriolis effect;
								Which in theory is linearly proportional to the amount of mass entering the measuring
								wheel per time and can be indirectly measured via the torque on the rotating axle.
								There are many benefits to this design, among them the ability to pick up on small flow
								rates (essential for kick detection during the most vunerable drilling process of pipe
								connection when flow is paused), having the measurement done at atmospheric conditions,
								and the independence of gas/foaming effects that plague the standard vibrating Coriolis
								Flow meter.
