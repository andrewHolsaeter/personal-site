				<p><strong>UiS Drillbotics</strong> This was the project that sparked my love for electronics,
					programming, and robotics. In my last semester of my masters degree in Petroleum Engineering, I
					blindly signed up to be the last member of my universities Drillbotics team and was handed the role
					of software/hardware programmer which to my surprise, no one else wanted. What followed was a
					semester full of all-nighters, hair pulling, and constant confusion but I loved every second. In the
					end, an unfortunate last minute switch to a different stabilizer resulted in failed pipe fittings
					and we finished tied for 3rd.</p>

				<h2>Flow Rate Out Sensor: Proof of Concept</h2>
				<h3 class="projectinfo">2018</h3>
				<h3 class="projectinfo">Size: 2</h3>
				<h3 class="projectinfo">Budget: $...</h3>
				<p>"The Macondo blowout in 2010 was caused by a series of events, and a main critical factor was the
					lack
					of accurate flow measurement as pointed out in the investigation that followed. The commonly used
					measurement device, the flow paddle, used on Deepwater Horizon, has an accuracy of 10%. This
					technology is still preferred due to the lack of alternatives."</p>
				<p>Thus, this project aimed to test a
					new and innovative design to replace the flow paddle which could have helped preventing the disaster
					of 2010.</p>

					up/simplified some of the electrical work and made progressive improvements to the collecting
